# Node School Modules

This is just my work completing the [Node school](http://nodeschool.io/) modules. 

If you'd like to test the solutions install node school using npm:

```
$ npm install -g learnyounode
```

After it's installed it's just a matter of cloning this repo and running the files as solutions to each example.

```
$ learnyounode
//select a problem
$ learnyounode verify solutionFile.js
```
